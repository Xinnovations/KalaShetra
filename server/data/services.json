    "social_content": "Caption:  Remember that feeling when a perfectly crafted joke lands?  That ripple of laughter spreading through the room, the shared moment of joy? That's what I handcraft, one hilarious punchline at a time.  My comedy isn't mass-produced; it's meticulously shaped from years of observing the human condition, of finding the absurdity in the everyday, and weaving it into stories that resonate. I pour my heart (and a whole lot of caffeine) into each performance, meticulously refining the delivery, the timing, the perfect pause before the killer line.  I don't just tell jokes; I create experiences. I build bridges of laughter, one audience member at a time. Ready for a show that's uniquely crafted for YOU?\n\nHashtags: #handcraftedcomedy #standupcomedy #comedian #supportsmallartists #comedylife #funny #laugh #jokes #livecomedy #giglife #artisancomedy #indiec Comedian #comedyperformance #thefunnybone #instacomedy #viralcomedy #comedylover #newtalent\n\n\nCall to Action:  Let me know in the comments what kind of jokes you love most â€“ dark humor, observational, puns?

    "pricingSuggestion": "The â‚¹4000 price for a stand-up comedian gig is likely too low.  Considering the time investment in writing, rehearsal, and travel (materials), plus the skill level required for a successful performance, a price range of â‚¹8000-â‚¹15000 is suggested.  This positions the comedian in the mid-range to premium market, depending on experience and venue.  Factors like audience size and event type should also influence pricing.  A key strategy: tiered pricing â€“ offer basic packages (â‚¹8000) and premium options (â‚¹15000) including extras like longer sets or tailored material. This allows for flexibility and caters to diverse client needs."
